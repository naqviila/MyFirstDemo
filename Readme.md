This is the repository for Assignment 3 and 4 work for ITECH2306, in 2021, Semester 2.

This folder contains an Eclipse project configured for Java. All that you will need to do is create a package in the 'src' folder, and then create Java classes within that.

Make sure that you clone this repository to your computer by following the instructions provided in the document titled "Using Eclipse IDE to interface with GitHub repositories" found on Moodle in the "Course Information" section, particularly the section of that document which is titled "Cloning a repository that is hosted on GitHub, into your Eclipse IDE – by using the import Wizard" from page 11 onwards. You should only need to clone the repository once on your computer.
